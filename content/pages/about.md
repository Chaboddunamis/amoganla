I am Abdul Oganla and I am the proud founder and Program Director of Africa-USA College Soccer Recruitment Tour (AUS Access), a student-athlete recruitment program. In less than two years, the program has helped facilitate more than a massive $1,000,000 worth of scholarships for its scholars.

Being one of four outstanding football talents from MTN Nigeria’s Football Scholar (2011) nationwide search who successfully  made it to a varsity in the U.S. on a full scholarship while playing for the college’s soccer team,  I  made it my lifework to provide young, talented athletes in Africa a platform to get similar opportunity that I enjoyed.

I benefited massively from the full-ride scholarship and attended college in America. Prior to this, I was the inaugural president and captain of the prestigious Segun Odegbami International College & Sports Academy.
I graduated from Knox College with a Bachelors in Economics and a minor in Business Management.
